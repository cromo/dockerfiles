# omniORBhy

This container contains a [hylang](http://hy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) programming environment with [omniORBpy](http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/docs.html) libraries installed. Just to make things clear, there is no package or library called omniORBhy; it is just a clever name for an image that contains both omniORBpy and Hy.
